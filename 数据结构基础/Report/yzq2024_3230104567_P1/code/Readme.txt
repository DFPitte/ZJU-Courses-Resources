Program description:This program is for solving the problem to find two integers in n given numbers.Two algorithms are designed to solve the problem,with the name of Algorithm1.c and algorithm2.c.

test1.c  is for the first algorithm,just open the document and compile and run with gcc.Time are calculated in the test program,and the test data are generated with the given input n and c. 
test2.c is the same,you have to input the n and c to run the program.
test1.c and test 2.c are the programs for testing.
